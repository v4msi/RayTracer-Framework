# RayTracer-Framework
The RayTracker Framework supports recursive ray tracing to render realistic reflections and refractions in 3D scenes. It enables smooth lighting effects on objects like spheres, walls, and custom shapes, including transparency for refraction, ensuring high-quality visuals of light-material interactions.
